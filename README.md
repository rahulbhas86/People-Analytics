Human resource analytics (HR analytics) is an area in the field of analytics that refers to applying analytic 
processes to the human resource department of an organization in the hope of improving employee performance and 
therefore getting a better return on investment. HR analytics does not just deal with gathering data on employee efficiency. 
Instead, it aims to provide insight into each process by gathering data and then using it to make relevant decisions about 
how to improve these processes.
